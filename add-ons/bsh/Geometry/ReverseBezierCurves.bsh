/// Commentary:

// This script will reverse the order of points in all the Bezier curve of the selection.  This is
// particularly useful when some curve is dashed, and the dash phase depends on the starting point.

// Installation:
// Put this file into your ${HOME}/.jpicedt/macros, then refresh the
// scripts under JpicEdit

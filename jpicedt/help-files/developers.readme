As of 2005/12, every localized version has its own manual LANG.texi and an "img" subdirectory where
translation maintainers can put language-specific pictures, e.g., those including localized legends.  Other
language-independent icons/pixmaps reside into the "./img" directory right here.

Guidelines for writing help files

- use this style `@kbd{CTRL}' for keyboard actions.
- use this style `@file{/home/user/.jpicedt/fragments}' for filenames.
- use this style `@dfn{new term}' for terminlogy that is being introduced.
- use this style `@var{nnn}' for some variable name nnn.
- use `@dots{}' instead of `...'.

Plus some additional macros from jpicedt macros.texi @include file:
- use this style `@menuItem{File}' for menu items.
- use this style `@dialogTab{some tab}' for dialog tabs.
- use this style `@dialogName{some dialog}' for dialog names.
- Do not duplicate information with i18n_LANG.properties files, but use the flag definition extracted from
  them.

Directory content:
./img:  pictures and icons that aren't language specific
./texi: common texinfo includes
licence.texi: CeCILL licence

We're seeking maintainers for the spanish and portugese versions!

    <p>This package contains helper classes for building a parser based on the well-known RegExp scheme,
    yet with a strong object-oriented approach in mind. Keyword <b>human-readibility</b> ! </p>
    <p> The base superclass of this package is the <code>AbstractRegularExpression</code> class. Two
    daughter classes then help building a grammar tree, namely 
    <code>AlternateExpression</code> and <code>SequenceExpression</code>, 
    which perform RegExp-like <b>OR</b> and <b>AND</b> operations respectively.
    <p>
    Regular expressions work hand-in-hand with two important classes :
    an instance of the <code>Context</code> class, 
    which is used to feed successive pieces of text to the set of reg-exp's that build up 
    the grammar tree, and an instance of the <code>Pool</code> class, 
    which allows regular expression to share data across the whole grammar tree.
    A <code>RootExpression</code> might then help building a stand-alone parser, by serving as a communication hub
    between the context, the pool and the various regular expressions that build up the tree.
    <p>
    We make use of the classical <b>callback</b> mechanism to process parsing events, yet 
    instead of using a unique, separate content-handler (e.g. as in most XML/HTML parsers), 
    each <code>AbstractRegularExpression</code>
    has its own content-handler, which is part of the same class, and is implemented
    in the core of the <code>action(ParserEvent e)</code> method. This allows subclasses to 
    easily specialize content-handling behaviour only, by simply overiding the latter method.
    (see e.g. <code>InstanciationExpression</code> for an example).
    <p>
    As a rule of thumb, developpers should as much as possible avoid dealing directly 
    with the Context instance in their own implementations, and rather rely on existing
    helper classes, since the latters already encapsulate much of the tricky communication scheme. 
    To set the stage, classes <code>LiteralExpression</code>, <code>NumericalExpression</code>,
    <code>StatementExpression</code> and <code>WordExpression</code> comprise a minimal set
    of helpers from which it might be easy to build a rather complicated grammar rule.
    Besides, classes <code>OptionalExpression</code> and <code>RepeatExpression</code> allow
    to handle RegExp-like <code>*</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>?</code> operations quite easily.

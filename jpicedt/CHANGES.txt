		- improved german translation by J. Hoffmann et al.
		- new curve plotter script by M. Perez
		- added new "join curves" method in PicMultiCurve. Aka
		  pscustom, yet less powerful since every element is converted
		  to a multicurve before joining.
February 2006:  - bug fix in AbstractCurveFormatter (psline related)
                - changed PsTricks to PSTricks
                - added new translations in online help + localized entries
December 2005:	- bug fix in PsCurve pstricks formatting
		- bug fix for: [ 1348102 ] duplicate polydots-size-minimum causes parser to abend
		- bug fix for: [ 1196453 ] Wrong syntax for pstricks
April 2005 :	- added PsCurve (experimental)
		- it's now possible to rescale the whole picture from the hosting TeX file
		  through the \JPicScale macro.
		- bug fix in Cut action (was: undoable-event not recorded)
		- improved context dependent help-messages in DrawToolFactory.
		- bug fix in Grid class (was: grid line style not properly set)
		- file chooser: default file extension now depends on
		  current content-type (e.g., PsTricks or Eepic)
[1_4_pre4]
X-mas 2004 : 	- fixed several bugs in installer (OS detection + bugs specific to MacOS-X).
		- fixed bug in group geometry customizer (width/height not properly reported).
		- bug fix in PageFormat/PECanvas's auto-formatting algorithm (bug when all objects had negative coordinates).
		- improved efficiency of HTML reader for on-line help and API doc.
		- added a handful of new BSH macros
XX/11/2004 :	- added support for editing parallelograms and ellipses with centre kept fixed
		- added support for editing parallelograms with a "square" constraint.
		- bounding-box now saved in XML preamble
		- added red mouse-markers in top and left rulers
		- EditPointMouseTransformFactory : added support for PicSmoothPolygon's coefficients editing with the mouse
		- added conversion from ellipses to Bezier curves
		- when converting an Element into another (e.g. parallelogram -> multicurve), z-ordering is now 
		  retained (work-around = Drawing.replaceElement)
		- added support for multiple grid styles
		- added a widget to change the grid step + added new menu item in preferences tabpane
		- added center-viewport button
		- improved setSymmetric() and setSmooth() for Bezier curves so that these methods also handles properly
		  the case when both the control- and the subdivision-point are similar.
		- improved popup-menu for Bezier curve: now permits editing properties of a single point or segment at a time
		- improved drawing scheme for Bezier curve: ultimate right-click allows to set tangent on last end-point.
		- added shear transform [pending: shear tool in toolbar]; so far, use a BSH script.
		- Bug fix: several menu's remained "grayed" when opening a picture from file and no sheet had previously been open.
		- Added a customizer for arrow parameters in dockable attribute-toolbar.
		- Also improved attribute-editor layout.
		- Brought on-line help up-to-date with new capabilities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1_4_pre3]
17/04/2004 :	- bug fix: "close file" in menu "file" didn't work + numerous other bugs related to frame activation.
		- partial bug fix: shadowing behavior under jPicEdt shows some discrepancies with PsTricks one.
		- bug fix (VG): PsCustom parameters not saved in XML part of output file.
		- bug fix (VG): improved handling of borders/shadows in \\pscustom command (AbstractCurveFormatter).  
03/04/2004 :    - bug fix: "fillstyle=black" was not set by default. Hence filling with black
		  produced a whitened shape, because PsTricks doesn't seem to fill in black by default,
		  whereas jPicEdt does. As a work-around, i simply added \psset{fillcolor=black} in the preambule.
		- buf fix: "userLineColour,]" syntax error when formatting to PsTricks. Was due to improper
		  "if/else" handling in pstricks.AbstractCurveFormatter.formatPsDots
		- added automatic page-format fitting on loading
		- bug fix: circles defined from 3 points were not properly copied to clipboard.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1_4_pre2]
01/11/2003 : 	- cleaned-up icons in jpicedt/images and i18n files
		- improved PsTricks's formatter for AbstractCurve's (i.e. use of \\pscustom not always necessary)
		- bug fix: BSH macros.
30/10/2003 :	- added customizer panel for user-editable kbd shortcuts (Edit->Preferences)
28/10/2003 : 	- refactored PropertyChangeEvent dispatching from EditorKit and PECanvas
26/10/2003 :	- improved painting scheme for polygon dots.
25/10/2003 :	- fixed bug in DefaultSelectionHandler : scale (i.e. through setPoint()) did not work
        	  properly when "mirroring" a selection. 
23/10/2003 :	- bug fix: formatting of arcs in the PsTricks format
		- bug fix: JPIC-XML fallback mechanism
		- bug fix: Pstricks not parsed because was missing in default grammar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1_4_pre1]
27/09/2003 :    - released 1.4-pre1
25/09/2003 :    - added Element.rotate() method, and jpicedt.graphic.toolkit.RotateTool.
                - added TEXT_ROTATION attribute to be used with PicText.
24/09/2003 :    - For clarity, split EditorKit.SelectionHandler off from EditorKit, now DefaultSelectionHandler lives on its own.
                - Added a delegate mechanism for highlighter painting through a separate HighlighterFactory.
                  This should fairly reduce the burden of subclassing DefaultViewFactory.
17/09/2003 :    - Added support for rotated ellipses to LaTeXFormatter.
12/09/2003 :    - [VG] updated on-line help (PicMultiCurve + PicSmoothPolygon)
                - [VG] PicCircleFrom3Pts now compiles fine again.
                - Added public interface PointIndexIterator and a default implementation, since
                  these iterators are now equally used to retrieve anchor-points indices as well
                  as to fetch a list of "visible" control-points in DefaultViewFactory.
                  This adds a good deal of flexibility to the latter where subclassing View's is concerned.
                - PicParallelogram : added SQUARE constraint. Code is still underway. Only P_TR works so far.
08/09/2003 :    - PicEllipse : corrected bug related to setPoint(P_ANGLE_XXX)
07/09/2003 :    - EditorKit.SelectionHandler: synchronization
                  between the handler content and the drawing is now 100% ok.
                  Modifying the content of the Drawing through the Drawing API
                  now doesn't raise NullPointerException anymore (e.g. BSH macros)
                - PicAttributeSet: added getAllowedValueClass() to 
                  PicAttributeName to allow type-checking of attribute value
                  at run-time (the best we can do)
                - EditorKit : edit-points mode is now working flawlessly.
                - DefaultViewFactory : added factory method createStrokeForHighlighter()
                  so that we may now straightforwardly change the appearance of
                  highlighters from a single place (this may be e.g. user-editable in the future).
                - improved jpicedt.test.TestCanvas test class by embedding it
                  with a BSH console. This should make test more easy to carry out.
26/08/2003 :    - added PicParallelogram and PicEllipseFromParallelo ; 
                - hence removed PicRectangle, PicEllipse and PicPolygon which were made redundant.
                - refactored code in jpicedt.graphic.model (modelling geometry)
                - enhanced PicPoint class by adding numerous geometry related algorithms
                - created new PicVector class working hand-in-hand with PicPoint
                - added EditPointConstraint, aka geometric constraints which can be imposed to setPoint() methods.
                - added edit-point mousetool dedicated to bezier curves.
                - added JPIC-XML language as jPicEdt's "native" format ; syntax somewhat mimics that of SVG.
                  Grammar not stabilized yet (no DtD yet).
	
21/01/2002 :    - added highLighter's painting during a mouse-transform
		- added PicMultiCurve (multi Bezier) and PicSmoothPoly (smooth polygon)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1_3_2]
12/08/2002 :    - created installer
                - fixed some GUI bugs related to threaded actions
                - worked out CR-LF problems with formatters
                - improved Ant's build.xml
                - changed user's preference file to user's preference directory
                - added Fragments menu
05/08/2002 :    - PsTricks : added \newpsobject, \psdots, \qdisk, made syntax rule closer to PsTricks grammar
		  where it was too tolerant. 
		- added "dot" attribute to polygons.
		- \makebox's (and related) arguments can now span more than one line.
		- LaTeX picture environment : enlarged the set of arguments \put can handle (beside LR-argument)
		  Useful mainly when loading files formatted by hand, or by another software.
		- added macros through support for BeanShell ; added many static methods in class JPicEdt
		  to ease macro development.
		- Parser has been refactored for efficiency ; added support for RegExp ; branches
		  can be now added to the parser tree from a BeanShell macro for user-made parsers...
 		- changed splash screen
		- updated on-line help.
		- took vacation.
21/07/2002 :    - fixed arrow size mismatch in PsTricks mode ; fixed repaint bug when attributes were changed
                  from the Attribute Editor ; improved Attribute Editor updating-scheme when a new 
		  element gets selected, or a new board is opened ; improved handling of mouse-hits for text
		  elements by cropping the hit-sensitive area to the text bound, whatever the frame box.
29/05/2002 :    - fixed bug with pstricks parsing of text alignment.
14/05/2002 :	- fixed bug with AttributeEditor (predefined colours panel disappeared now and often for obscure reasons)
		- fixed bug with epic/eepic parsing of text alignment, which
		  resulted in text objects being displayed at y=0
		- fixed bug with incorrect parsing of \makebox commands
		  (esp. when no box size was given)
07/05/2002 :    - fixed some bugs with external commands ; added MikTeX scripts.
15/04/2002 :	- added floating tool-bars as a replacement of "per-board" toolbars, 
		  which made memory consumption very high.
		- fixed bug with undo/redo for attributes editing. Now, compound
		  attributes edits are ended by a deselection.
		- added experimental support for ModalInternalFrame.
14/04/2002 : 	- added RenderingHints (anti-aliasing,...) to PECanvas. New bug : turning anti-aliasing 
		  on make texture rendering (i.e. cross-hatches) look somewhat weird now
		  and often. Is it Java ? Any clue welcomed...
		- fixed bug with MoveTool and ScaleTool not registering undoable events.
		- fixed bug with i18n'ing of undoable PEAction's and of Parser messages
		- added Arrows to PicEllipse formatters in format.latex.*, format.eepic.*, and LaTeXParser
		- added manual editing of Bounding Box (usefull when text boxes lie on a picture edge)
		- fixed bug with DOTTED line style for LaTeXViewFactory ; 
		  now matches what the LaTeX format can really handle (i.e. DOTTED line-style is 
		  NOT supported natively !). If you really want to use dotted line-style, you may want
		  to consider using PsTricks instead.
		
13/04/2002 : 	- fixed bug with "Cut" action (didn't copy to clipboard)
		- fixed bug with polygon formatting in LaTeX mode, and unitlength parsing ("mm" string)
		- fixed bug with language not being initialized in Preferences
		- fixed bug with Look'n Feel not being loaded properly on startup.
		- fixed bug with MaxUndoableSteps not being stored in preferences.
		- fixed bug with Font selection not being reflected on the drawing
		
05/03/2002 :	- added new MouseTool's : "move" and "resize" (these are
		  add-ons to the MouseTransform's of the same name, i.e. can be used as 
		  stand-alone MouseTool's w/o relying on SelectionTool)
		- all properties dialog boxes are now subclasses or
		  AbstractCustomizer ; a CustomizerDialog has been implemented, which know how to
		  add AbstractCustomizer's. 

		  
26/02/2002 : 	- completed tree structure for Drawing, Element and View's ;
		  optimized calls to repaint ;
		- CursorFactory now caches custom cursors;
		- PicEllipse now inherits from PicRectangle; added two
		  end-points for editing angles.
		- MouseTransform's for SelectionTool are now created by a MouseTransformFactory, 
		  using a HitInfo returned by the hitTest method located in the View associated with the
		  clicked Element ; can be easily subclassed by plug-ins
		  designer to add their own editing-tools.
		- added new MouseTransform's : add/remove point for polygons,
		  move endpoints from center, InvalidTransform with custom cursor. Added
		  "setPointFromCenter" to PicRectangle and subclasses.
		- changed DrawPointIterableTool : EditorKit now uses a DrawToolFactory
		  which produces MouseTool's specific for each class of Element to be drawn, 
		  Each tool specifies what end-points we must set at each mouse-pressed, and in which
		  order. Plug-in designers can easily subclass this factory to
		  add their own graphic elements and related drawing tools.
				
10/02/2002 : 	- added ViewFactory + View + modified PicObject to implement a tree structure.
                  Changed name "PicObject" to "Element".
09/02/2002 : 	- fixed bug with Grid lines not being repainted correctly
             	- TextEditable is now ok -> using g.scale(1,-1) when painting text avoids using tricky tricks to
	     	  circumvent the pb of text being mirrored.
08/02/2002 : 	- implemented model-coordinate system through an AffineTransform in
	     	  PECanvas's paintComponent method ; now, PicObject's are stored in
	     	  "natural" coordinates (aka LaTeX or PostScript coordinates).
	     	  Besides, PEMouseListener's may now directly access mouse coordinates in
	     	  the model-coordinates system through PEMouseEvent.getPicPoint().
05/02/2002 : 	- Package reorganisation ; separate the main tree into
		  jpicedt.ui (the application itself) and jpicedt.graphic (the
		  library)
		- Model/control/view architecture is now ok : created three packages :
		  jpicedt.graphic.view, jpicedt.graphic.model and
		  jpicedt.graphic.toolkit. PECanvas delegates most of the
		  editing behaviour to a pluggable EditorKit. EditorKit's know
		  how to register and unregister MouseTool's, and backs reference
		  to them in a HashTable ; this makes it easy for plug-ins
		  designer to add their own MouseTool's.
		- Multi-document-interface is now managed by a concrete implementation of
		  a MDIManager interface (either using JInternalFrame's or
		  JFrame's).
		- Created a PEAction implementation of Swing's AbstractAction,
		  which knows, using an ActionDispatcher, upon which target (PECanvas) it must act.
06/01/2002 : - package jpicedt.graphic finally compiles ok. Pb with jpicedt.ui
07/12/2001 : - fixed bug with frame's size in DlgBoxPreferences on some JVM implementation (pack() not working)

29/11/2001 : - fixed bug with ListenerThread not getting properly initialized in SystemOutUtilities
	      - fixed bug @ PicRectangle.paint in LaTeX mode : forgot to call g.draw(etc..)
	      - improved PicLine paint method by addind the "LINE_STYLE=DOTTED" case
	      - added paint-related methods in PicObject that factors common behavior depending on current formater mode
	      - improved PsTricks formater by adding "linestyle=dotted"
01/12/2001 : - made some I/O methods thread-safe (those relying on background threads for time consuming tasks) 
	    	      => can now be called from outside AWTEventDispatchThread :
			 - jpicedt.gui.internal.PECanvas.read
			 - jpicedt.io.parser.LaTeXParser.parse
			 - jpicedt.io.SystemOutUtilities.SystemOutFoFrame.<init>
	      - added a DebugRepaintManager in jpicedt.util.gui to help debugging Swing repaint mechanism
		      
02/12/2001 : - fixed (long-awaited !) bug with PEScrollPane size update during a zoom operation (I got muddled up over
		those multiple calls to repaint() and revalidate(), whereas ONE was enough, but at the RIGHT place !!!)
	     - fixed parser bug in io.parser.picedt.DashStatement (forgot setAttribute(LINE_STYLE,DASHED))
03/12/2001 : - reorganized packages : deleted sub-packages under jpicedt.util, moved to jpicedt.gui ;
	       moved jpicedt.gui.internal and jpicedt.gui.tool to jpicedt.graphic and sub-packages
04/12/2001 : - added Arrows to PicPolygon.paint and to PicPolygonFormater
05/12/2001 : - added arrows to io.parser.picedt.PicPolygonExpression
	     - fixed bug with dash parameter not being formated correctly with rectangles
	     - added isToBack and isToFront in Drawing ; now EditDispositionAction in PECanvasPopupMenu 
	       can be enabled/disabled depending on the target PicObject disposition.
	     - added convertToCubic and convertToQuad action's in jpicedt.graphic.action.
06/11/2001 : - adapted PicBezier from quad to cubic spline
09/11/2001 : - adapted PicBezierFormater, and related parser expressions
11/11/2001 : - lumped all DrawXXXXTool's together in jpicedt.gui.tool package
	     - added a PicPointIterable class under PicObject for objects that support iteration over their control points
	        now there's one DrawTool that can handle a variety of PicObject's (instead of nearly one for each PicObject before)
13/11/2001 : - corrected bug with PicBezier parser (was absent from LateXParser's grammar)
	     - added parsing and formating of PsTricks's user defined colours
15/11/2001 : - added color chooser in properties panel, to handle user's defined colours
19/09/2001 : - fixed : spline selection bug, linethickness parsing, makebox alignment parsing, polygon's "closed" attribute parsing 
16/10/2001 : - modified Parser structure and added some packages for PsTricks support
23/10/2001 : - added 90% of PsTricks support (colours, arrows, dash...)

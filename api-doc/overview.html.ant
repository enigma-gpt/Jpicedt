    <p>This document is the API specification for jPicEdt @VERSION@ </p>

    <p>The tree class contains three main branches:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> <code>jpicedt.graphic.*</code> : these are the core packages ; they provide
	a canvas where we can draw and edit graphical elements, classes for
	modeling graphical elements and their attributes, editor kits and event
	management, and general contracts for formatters and parsers. This
	branch can be used (and compiled) independently of jpicedt.ui.*.
	<li> <code>jpicedt.ui.*</code> : this is the user interface for the jPicEdt
	application.
	<li> <code>jpicedt.format.*</code> : concrete implementation of
	formatters/parsers/view-factories for various content-types. Developpers might easily add new
	content-type implementation here (e.g. postscript, PDF,&hellip;). See
	<a href="jpicedt/MiscUtilities.html">jpicedt.MiscUtilities</a> to know how to register new content-types.
	<li> <code>jpicedt.test.*</code> : this branch is for developpers only.
	<li> <code>jpicedt.widgets.*</code> : provide some (Swing) widgets that can be
	used independently of the rest of the tree.
	</ul>
